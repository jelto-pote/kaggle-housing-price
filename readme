This code was written for a microproject for Sopra Steria

- The runtime, data and model properties are defined in config/*.json files
- The chosen metric was Root mean square error.

To improve:

Code:
- Fix the API on Heroku

EDA/Features:
    - Plot coordinates on a map, decipher "area_type" based on external data sources (cfr. next point)
    - Separate cities, semi-rural and rural areas. Comparison of data **within** a certain context could be beneficial, instead of comparing all data with all data. Different mechanisms can be at play in different areas - like in a city, more population could mean higher prices (nice view, cool skyscrapers, nice place to live, close to interesting things. In rural areas, a relatively high population could be seen as a disadvantage because people are looking for solitude and calmness. So different principles could possibly guide different types of areas
    - Try out more features
    - Remove outliers
    - Include cross validation in objective functions
